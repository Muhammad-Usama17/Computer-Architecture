        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment which converts information into human readable form. 
            It can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, and video.
            Some of the output devices are Visual Display Units (VDU) i.e. a Monitor, Printer graphic Output devices, 
            Plotters, Speakers etc. A new type of Output device is being developed these days, known as Speech synthesizer, 
            a mechanism attached to the computer which produces verbal output sounding almost like human speeches.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Examples of output devices :</p>

        <h2 style="padding-left: 20px; color:#E46C0A">Monitor</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            A display device is the most common form of output device. It presents output visually on computer screen. 
            The output appears temporarily on the screen and can easily altered or erased, it is sometimes referred to 
            as soft copy also. The display device for a desktop PC is called monitor.
            With all-in-one PCs, notebook computers, hand held PCs and other devices; the term display screen is 
            used for the display device. The display devices are also used in home entertainment systems, mobile systems, 
            cameras and video games.

        <p style="padding-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">There are three types of minitors :</p><br>
            <p style="padding-left:45px;"><b style="color: #E46C0A;">a. CRT (Cathod Ray Tube) :</b> A cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube 
                containing one or more electron guns, the beams of which are manipulated to display images on a 
                phosphorescent screen. The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures 
                (television set, computer monitor), radar targets, or other phenomena. A CRT on a television set is 
                commonly called a picture tube. CRTs have also been used as memory devices, in which case the screen 
                is not intended to be visible to an observer.

            <p style="padding-left: 45px;"><b style="color: #E46C0A;">b. LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) :</b>
                A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical 
                device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. 
                Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in 
                color or monochrome. LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) 
                or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden. For instance: preset words, 
                digits, and seven-segment displays, as in a digital clock, are all good examples of devices with these displays. 
                They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels, 
                while other displays have larger elements. LCDs can either be normally on (positive) or off (negative), 
                depending on the polarizer arrangement. For example, a character positive LCD with a backlight will have black 
                lettering on a background that is the color of the backlight, and a character negative LCD will have a black 
                background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight. Optical filters are added to white on blue 
                LCDs to give them their characteristic appearance.

            <p style="padding-left: 45px;"><b style="color: #E46C0A;">c. LED (Light Emitting Diode) :</b>
                A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. 
                Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. 
                The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for 
                electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor. White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors 
                or a layer of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device.

        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            A printer is a peripheral machine which makes a persistent representation of graphics or text, 
            usually on paper. While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an example of an 
            expanded use for printers. The different types of printers include 3D printer, inkjet printer, 
            laser printer, thermal printer, etc.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left:20px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">There are two basic types :</p>
            <img src="images/Impact Printer.png" alt="Impact Printer" style="float:right; width: 250px;
            padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 30px;"><br>

                <p style="padding-left: 75px;"><b style="color: #E46C0A;">a. Impact Printer :</b> Impact printers 
                    rely on a forcible impact to transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits 
                    the surface of the ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), 
                    or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the IBM 1403 for example). 
                    All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the 
                    characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, 
                    or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could 
                    be done by "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or 
                    slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, 
                    daisywheel printers, dot matrix printers, and line printers. Dot-matrix printers remain in common use in businesses 
                    where multi-part forms are printed. An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many 
                    of the technologies used.</p><br><br><br><br>

                <p style="padding-left: 75px;"><b style="color: #E46C0A;">b. Dot-Matrix Printer :</b> A dot matrix printer is an 
                    impact printer that prints using a fixed number of pins or wires. Typically the pins or wires 
                    are arranged in one or several vertical columns. The pins strike an ink-coated ribbon and force contact 
                    between the ribbon and the paper, so that each pin makes a small dot on the paper. The combination of 
                    these dots forms a dot matrix image. They were also known as serial dot matrix printers.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 75px;"><b style="color: #E46C0A;">a. Inkjet Printer :</b> Inkjet printer is a type 
                    of computer printers that recreates a digital image by propelling droplets of ink onto paper 
                    and plastic substrates. Inkjet printers are the most commonly used type of printer, and 
                    range from small inexpensive consumer models to expensive professional machines.
                    The concept of inkjet printing originated in the 20th century, and the technology was 
                    first extensively developed in the early 1950s. While working at Canon in Japan, Ichiro Endo 
                    came up with the idea for a "Bubble jet" printer, while around the same time Jon Vaught at 
                    HP was developing a similar idea. In the late 1970s, inkjet printers that could reproduce 
                    digital images generated by computers were developed, mainly by Epson, Hewlett-Packard (HP) and 
                    Canon. In the worldwide consumer market, four manufacturers account for the majority of inkjet printer 
                    sales: Canon, HP, Epson and Brother.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                <p style="padding-left: 75px;"><b style="color: #E46C0A;">b. Laser Printer :</b> Laser printing is an 
                    electrostatic digital printing process. It produces high-quality text and graphics 
                    (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth 
                    over a negatively charged cylinder called a "drum" to define a differentially charged image. 
                    The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the 
                    image to paper, which is then heated in order to permanently fuse the text, imagery, or both, 
                    to the paper. As with digital photocopiers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process. 
                    Laser printing differs from traditional xerography as implemented in analog photocopiers in that in 
                    the latter, the image is formed by reflecting light off an existing document onto the exposed drum.</p>

            Computer speakers, or multimedia speakers, are speakers sold for use with computers, although usually 
            capable of other audio uses, e.g. for an MP3 player. Most such speakers have an internal amplifier and 
            consequently require a power source, which may be by a mains power supply often via an AC adapter, 
            batteries, or a USB port. The signal input connector is often a 3.5 mm jack plug (usually color-coded 
            lime green per the PC 99 standard); RCA connectors are sometimes used, and a USB port may supply both 
            signal and power (requiring additional circuitry, and only suitable for use with a computer). 
            Battery-powered wireless Bluetooth speakers require no connections at all. Most computers have speakers of 
            low power and quality built in; when external speakers are connected they disable the built-in speakers. 
            Altec Lansing claims to have created the computer speaker market in 1990.
            Computer speakers range widely in quality and in price. Computer speakers sometimes packaged 
            with computer systems are small, plastic, and have mediocre sound quality. Some computer speakers 
            have equalization features such as bass and treble controls. Bluetooth speakers can be connected 
            with a computer by using an Aux jack and compatible adaptor.

            A plotter produces vector graphics drawings. Plotters draw lines on paper using a pen, or in some applications, 
            use a knife to cut a material like vinyl or leather. In the latter case, they are sometimes known as a cutting plotter.
            In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided design, as they were able to produce line drawings 
            much faster and of a higher quality than contemporary conventional printers. Smaller desktop plotters were often used 
            for business graphics. Printers with graphics capabilities took away some of the market by the early 1980s, 
            and the introduction of laser printers in the mid-1980s largely eliminated the use of plotters from most roles.           
            Plotters retained a niche for producing very large drawings for many years, but have now largely been 
            replaced by wide-format conventional printers. Cutting plotters remain in use in a number of industries.
