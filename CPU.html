            A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, 
            is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs 
            basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in 
            the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized 
            processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation 
            remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that 
            performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store 
            the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and 
            execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            Most modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more 
            CPUs on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) IC chip. Microprocessors chips with multiple CPUs are 
            multi-core processors. The individual physical CPUs, processor cores, can also be multithreaded to 
            create additional virtual or logical CPUs.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; 
            such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 370px;">
            Array processors or vector processors have multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no 
            unit considered central. Virtual CPUs are an abstraction of dynamical aggregated computational resources.

        <h2 style="padding-left: 20px;">Operations of CPUs :</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            The fundamental operation of most CPUs, regardless of the physical form they take, is to execute a 
            sequence of stored instructions that is called a program. The instructions to be executed are kept in 
            some kind of computer memory. Nearly all CPUs follow the fetch, decode and execute steps in their operation, 
            which are collectively known as the instruction cycle.
        </p><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 45px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">There are three main types of operations :</p>
        <ul style="color: #E46C0A; padding-left: 75px;">
            <li>Fetch</li>
            <li>Decode</li>
            <li>Execute</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>We will talk briefly about each of them.</b></p>
        <img src="images/line.png" style="width: 98.6%; height: 2px; padding: 10px;">
        <h2 style="padding-left: 20px;">Fetch</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            The first step, fetch, involves retrieving an instruction (which is represented by a number or 
            sequence of numbers) from program memory. The instruction's location (address) in program memory 
            is determined by the program counter (PC; called the "instruction pointer" in Intel x86 microprocessors), 
            which stores a number that identifies the address of the next instruction to be fetched. After an instruction 
            is fetched, the PC is incremented by the length of the instruction so that it will contain the 
            address of the next instruction in the sequence.[d] Often, the instruction to be fetched must be 
            retrieved from relatively slow memory, causing the CPU to stall while waiting for the instruction to 
            be returned. This issue is largely addressed in modern processors by caches and pipeline architectures (see below).
        </p>
        <img src="images/line.png" style="width: 98.6%; height: 1.5px; padding: 10px;">
        <h2 style="padding-left: 20px;">Decode</h2>
        <p style="padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 35px;">
            The instruction that the CPU fetches from memory determines what the CPU will do. In the decode step, 
            performed by the circuitry known as the instruction decoder, the instruction is converted into signals 
            that control other parts of the CPU.<br>
            The way in which the instruction is interpreted is defined by the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA). 
            Often, one group of bits (that is, a "field") within the instruction, called the opcode, indicates which 
            operation is to be performed, while the remaining fields usually provide supplemental information required 
            for the operation, such as the operands. Those operands may be specified as a constant value 
            (called an immediate value), or as the location of a value that may be a processor register or a memory address, 
            as determined by some addressing mode.<br>
            In some CPU designs the instruction decoder is implemented as a hardwired, unchangeable circuit. 
            In others, a microprogram is used to translate instructions into sets of CPU configuration signals that 
            are applied sequentially over multiple clock pulses. In some cases the memory that stores the microprogram 
            is rewritable, making it possible to change the way in which the CPU decodes instructions.
        </p>
        <img src="images/line.png" style="width: 98.6%; height: 1.5px; padding: 10px;">
        <h2 style="padding-left: 20px;">Execute</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 50px;">
            After the fetch and decode steps, the execute step is performed. Depending on the CPU architecture, 
            this may consist of a single action or a sequence of actions. During each action, various parts of the 
            CPU are electrically connected so they can perform all or part of the desired operation and then the action 
            is completed, typically in response to a clock pulse. Very often the results are written to an internal CPU 
            register for quick access by subsequent instructions. In other cases results may be written to slower, but less 
            expensive and higher capacity main memory.<br>
            For example, if an addition instruction is to be executed, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) inputs 
            are connected to a pair of operand sources (numbers to be summed), the ALU is configured to perform an addition 
            operation so that the sum of its operand inputs will appear at its output, and the ALU output is connected to 
            storage (e.g., a register or memory) that will receive the sum. When the clock pulse occurs, the sum will be 
            transferred to storage and, if the resulting sum is too large (i.e., it is larger than the ALU's output word size), 
            an arithmetic overflow flag will be set.
